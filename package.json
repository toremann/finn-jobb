  "description": "To use the getJobs function, pass a location argument to filter the job results by location. The function fetches job data from the Finn.no API, with a delay of 1 to 10 seconds between each page request to avoid overloading the API. The fetched job data is stored in an array, which is then filtered by the specified location and returned as a promise.",
